# Pathfinding Visualizations!
#### This repo takes place of the "Assets" folder in a Unity 2021.3.3f1 project!
This is a visualization tool for 4 pathfinding algorithms
Algorithms:
* Depth first search (4 directional)
* Breadth first search (4 directional)
* Greedy/Best first search (4 and 8 directional)
* A* (4 and 8 directional)

#### Installation
Sadly, there are currently no release builds, but the project is at a stage I would call "finished" so you can download the source and build it yourself. You can also wait until the future, as I will eventually release a build when I feel like it lol
